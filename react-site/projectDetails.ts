The dataset includes customer demographics, product details, sales transactions, and financial metrics, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of sales performance across different locations, product categories, and time periods.

The process began with data cleaning in SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by exploratory queries to uncover trends in sales, profit margins, and customer purchasing behavior. A Tableau dashboard was then developed, providing an interactive overview of key metrics such as sales and profit over time, product performance, and regional trends. By leveraging these insights, businesses can better understand their top-performing products, seasonal sales patterns, and customer preferences, ultimately improving strategic decision-making and profitability.

A dynamic Tableau dashboard was then developed, allowing users to compare cities, filter by demographics, and dive deeper into travel behaviors. While the datasetâ€™s size poses challenges for query performance, these analyses can be regularly updated as new data is collected, helping the agency adapt to evolving travel trends and make data-driven decisions.`,
